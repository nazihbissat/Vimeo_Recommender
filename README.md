**Abstract**


Recommendation Systems for video channels
are highly investigated areas in the
machine learning domain because of their
importance in retaining viewers. This paper
presents a comparison between two
recommendation systems developed on
the basis of a similarity index between
a video and all other videos in Vimeoâ€™s
staff picks database released in January
of 2018. The first model extracts text,
thumbnail, and numerical features individually
and used categories as a proxy
for accuracy of prediction of top k recommended
clips. The second model puts
these three features in one feature space
through normalization and dimensionality
reduction and returns a list of top ten similar
video clips based on distance. It was
found that Model 1 yielded total category
matching of 37.1% with text, which consequently
validated the proposal of Model
2 both. In the future, Model 2 would be
further optimized by user input to weigh
features based on similarity or creating a
graph where a more robust algorithm such
as Page Rank could more accurately offer
recommendations, though not necessarily
based on similarity.
